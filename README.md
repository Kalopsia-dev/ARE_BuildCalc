# Arelith Build Calculator
 
A versatile character builder for Microsoft Excel, based on [Kamiryn's Character Build Calculator](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/characterbuildcalculator-cbc) (V2) for [Neverwinter Nights](https://www.beamdog.com/games/neverwinter-nights-enhanced). Tailored for [Arelith](https://nwnarelith.com), a vibrant roleplaying community in the Forgotten Realms setting, it features most of the server's custom mechanics, such as character classes, paths, (sub-)races and gifts, all integrated in a redesigned UI.

Arelith Build Calculator also supports a unique gear calculator that lets users specify their characters' equipment and include relevant item properties in various calculations.
