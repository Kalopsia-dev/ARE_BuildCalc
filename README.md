# Arelith Build Calculator
 
A versatile character builder based on [Kamiryn's original Character Build Calculator for Neverwinter Nights](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/characterbuildcalculator-cbc) that includes most character classes, paths, (sub-)races, gifts and custom game mechanics available on the [Arelith persistent role playing server](https://nwnarelith.com), all integrated in an overhauled Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. There is also a gear calculator that will let you plan your characters' equipment and include the resulting bonuses in the build calculator's output.

Please note that this tool is being tested and developed exclusively in Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet software may or may not work as expected.
